# Adobe 2D shapes Shapes Detection, Symmtery Detection (Horizontal, Vertical, Diagonal) and Boundary Definer

This Python file incorporates code designed to identify and quantify distinct shapes within an image. Subsequently, it determines the presence of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of symmetry for these shapes. The script utilizes test images as a benchmark, and the corresponding results are included as well.
It also contains the code that will define the boundaries of shapes with the 2D shapes as per the test given in Adobe problem statement.
